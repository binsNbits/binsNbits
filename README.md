# Hello World
- 👋 Hi, I’m @binsNbits
- 👀 I’m interested in Cybersecurity, programming, diagraming, analytics and the like. 
- 🌱 I’m always learning new things and progressing in things learned. 
- 💞️ I have a personal Github account. However, I have started this Github account afresh as I wish for this to be more of a freelancing based account, showcasing and/or 'POC'ing
- my experience and projects that relate to any interests of mine and a potential client's. 
- 📫 How to reach me : I can be reached at jrssrj85@gmail.com

I look forward to this new, fresh journey of mine and hope to become part of other's journeys along the way :)
